# Project Plan - Team Sprint #4

## Team: cs6440-2020-19

## 1 Introduction

Patients need to fill out a form prior to seeing a virtual physician for the first time. 
The project looks for a solution by creating an application to auto-populate those forms.

## 2 Development

- Tools used:
1) Docker;
2) Drone;
3) Helm;
4) Kubernetes;

- Languages:
1) Python
2) Flask

### Tasks
**Done:**
- Collect Information to start Team Project.
1) Understand theme;
2) First call with external mentor;

Description: The group was given a theme: 12 - IHR Data to Virtual Care Apps. Organization: UHC.
In order to start the project, we needed to collect some information. We needed to fully understand the problem by doing
research and having a phone call with a UHC representative.

- FrontEnd development:
1) Create First Screen Prototypes;
2) Setup dockerfile for FrontEnd, drone and values files;


Description: There are pages to access patients' Health Records and intake forms for a Virtual Visit. The UHC mentor shared some real world pages they use on a daily basis. Our team created our own design for a patient's page, based on the pages shared by the mentor.

- BackEnd development:
1) Run a "Hello World" program

Description: In order to start our development, the team worked on running a hello world app through the deployment process.

2) Connect to Georgia Tech’s FIHR server: In order to link our program to auto-fill the form, we won’t use real data provided by UHC. We’ll use a database from Georgia Tech;

Description: The application will be able to connect to the Georgia Tech’s FIHR server to collect data, select data
for a specific patient and automatically fill the form with the collected data.
Input: Georgia Tech’s FIHR server.
Output: A patient's record.



**To do:**
- FrontEnd development: 
1) Build layout prototype of “initiate” page;
2) Build layout prototype of “intake form” page;

Description: The team will develop a prototype application. It will include a page where a user (patient) can acccess.
That page will have a form with a few textboxes and buttons.

- BackEnd development:
1) Integrate backend functionalities with frontend development;


- Group Slack meetings: 
1) Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Sundays from 7pm to 8pm;

Description: In order to keep the group engaged, we'll have constant meetings on Slack.

- Team calls with external mentor from UHC: 
1) Fridays at 12pm;

Description: In order to have feedback on our development, we'll have calls once a week with an external mentor.
